# KMC Notes

This directory should be added to your paths and kmc.sh should be able to be called.  Also, the directory containing the KMC executibles (kmc, kmc_dump, and kmc_tools) should also be in your paths and able to be called.  The easiest way to do this would be to copy the KMC executibles into this directory and run

``` bash
PATH=$PATH:<path_to_this_directory>
```

Since KMC isn't one of our programs, it should be downloaded from [here](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=projects&project=kmc&subpage=about).
